# Hospitality-Industry-Dashboard-Power-BI
The Challenge was all about creating a dashboard for the Revenue Management team of Atliq Grand hotel chain, which can provide key insights on Revenue trend .

# Problem Statement: 
AtliQ Grands, a renowned five-star hotel chain in India, has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Recently, the company has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective management decisions. To address this issue, the managing director of AtliQ Grands decided to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market position and revenue. However, they lack an in-house data analytics team, prompting the revenue management team to hire a third-party service provider for insights from their historical data.

# Visualization Tool: 
Power BI
# Database: 
Excel
# Process:
1.	Importing and verifying data, with transformations and cleaning in Power Query.
2.	Data modeling.
3.	Identifying and creating measures using DAX.
4.	Validating all data.
5.	Creating a dashboard using appropriate visualizations.

# Created following KPI's using DAX -

1.Total Bookings
2.Total Revenue
3.Average Rating
4.Total Capacity
5.Total Successful bookings
6.Occupancy %
7.Total Cancelled Bookings
8.Cancellation Rate
9.Revenue Loss
10.Total Stay


# Dashboard Insights for the Revenue Team:
1.	Developed four dashboards: Overall Analysis, Revenue Analysis, Booking Analysis, and Rating Analysis.
2.	Conducted analysis on various parameters to provide insights based on the revenue team's requirements.
3.	Found that Mumbai city contributes the highest revenue throughout all months.
4.	Identified that a drop in booking percentage, not the cancellation percentage (which remains consistent at 24-25% throughout all months), is the major cause of revenue decline.
5.	Determined that AtliQ Exotica and AtliQ Palace are the highest revenue-generating hotels.
6.	Recommended that AtliQ strengthen connections with the MakeMyTrip and LogTrip platforms, as bookings from these platforms are down by 31%. Additionally, noted that around 40% of revenue comes from unorganized sources, which need to be identified for better marketing efforts.
7.	Observed that AtliQ Blu has the highest average rating, while AtliQ Seasons has the lowest rating.
